💸 Money Can Buy Happiness
…and I have the regression plot to prove it (kinda).

Welcome to the most emotionally unstable machine-learning project you’ll find today.

In this repo, we explore the age-old question:

“Can money buy happiness?”

And according to my linear regression?
Sort of. Like… 60%.
Which is honestly higher than expected for both money and linear regression.

🚀 Project Overview

This project uses the GDP vs Happiness dataset from Our World In Data to analyze whether richer countries are, statistically speaking, happier.

We:

Cleaned the dataset (lightly, because data hygiene is a myth)

Ran a linear regression

Discovered R² ≈ 0.6 (yay?)

Concluded that money solves most things, but not everything — sadly.

📊 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas (the emotional support library)

Scikit-Learn (for pretending everything is linear)

Matplotlib (for pretty lies)

🧠 Key Findings
Question	Answer
Does money buy happiness?	Mostly. About 60%.
Does GDP explain everything?	No. Your childhood trauma still matters.
Should you become rich?	Always.
